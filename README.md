# Pi-Pages: Advanced Web Automation Tool

A robust, enterprise-grade web automation tool designed for continuous browsing and monitoring of multiple websites. Built with Python and Selenium, featuring advanced error handling, self-healing capabilities, and comprehensive monitoring.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-site browsing**: Automatically cycles through a configurable list of URLs
- **Tab management**: Opens each URL in a new tab and closes it after viewing
- **Infinite looping**: Continuously cycles through all URLs
- **Configurable intervals**: Adjustable time spent on each page (30-180 seconds)

### Advanced Error Handling & Self-Healing
- **URL validation**: Pre-validates URLs before visiting
- **Browser crash recovery**: Automatically restarts browser up to 5 times
- **Retry logic**: Retries failed visits up to 3 times with different strategies
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues running even if some URLs fail
- **Memory management**: Monitors memory usage and restarts browser if needed

### Anti-Detection & Stealth
- **User agent rotation**: Randomly selects from multiple user agents
- **Proxy support**: Configurable proxy rotation
- **Random delays**: Unpredictable timing between actions
- **URL shuffling**: Randomizes URL order to avoid patterns
- **Browser fingerprinting evasion**: Disables automation indicators

### Performance & Monitoring
- **Real-time metrics**: Tracks success rates, load times, and performance
- **Adaptive intervals**: Automatically adjusts timing based on success rate
- **Memory monitoring**: Tracks memory usage and prevents leaks
- **Comprehensive logging**: Rotating log files with detailed activity tracking
- **Performance analytics**: Saves metrics to JSON for analysis

### Enterprise Features
- **Configuration management**: JSON-based configuration without code changes
- **Log rotation**: Automatic log file management (10MB max, 5 backups)
- **Signal handling**: Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C
- **Resource management**: Efficient memory and process handling
- **Production ready**: Suitable for 24/7 operation

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (automatically managed by Selenium)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Option 1: Direct Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pi-pages
```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install ChromeDriver (if not already installed):**

## ⚙️ Configuration

The tool uses JSON configuration files for easy customization:

### URLs Configuration (`urls.json`)

The application loads URLs from `urls.json` file, organized by categories:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    {
      "category": "Tech News & Updates",
      "urls": [
        "https://www.theverge.com/",

        "https://www.wired.com/"
      ]
    },
    {
      "category": "Developer Resources",
      "urls": [
        "https://github.com/trending",

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New URLs

1. Edit `urls.json` to add new URLs in appropriate categories
2. Restart the application to load new URLs

### Creating Custom URL Sets

You can create multiple URL files for different purposes:

```bash
# Create a development-focused URL set
cp urls.json dev-urls.json
# Edit dev-urls.json to include only development resources

# Run with custom URL set
python pi-pages.py --urls dev-urls.json
```

### Filtering by Category

The application provides methods to filter URLs by category:

```python
# Get all URLs from a specific category
tech_urls = pi_pages.get_urls_by_category("Tech News & Updates")

# Get all available categories
categories = pi_pages.get_available_categories()
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 pi-pages.py
```

### Direct Execution (if made executable)
```bash
./pi-pages.py
```

### Package Installation Usage
```bash
# After installing with pip install .
pi-pages
```

### With Custom Configuration
```bash
python3 pi-pages.py config.json
```

### Running in Background
```bash
nohup python3 pi-pages.py > output.log 2>&1 &
```

### Stopping the Script
- Press `Ctrl+C` for graceful shutdown
- The script will save metrics and close the browser properly

## 📊 Monitoring & Logs

```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. ChromeDriver not found:**
```bash
# Install ChromeDriver
brew install chromedriver  # macOS
sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver  # Ubuntu
```

**2. Memory issues:**
- Reduce `max_memory_usage` in config
- Increase `memory_check_interval`
- Restart the script periodically

**3. High failure rate:**
- Increase `interval` to reduce server load
- Add proxies to avoid rate limiting
- Check URL accessibility manually

**4. Browser crashes:**
- Increase `max_browser_restarts`
- Check system resources
- Update Chrome browser

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging by modifying the logging level in the script:
```python
self.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```
